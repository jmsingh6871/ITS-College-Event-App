      '''Data Science, an inter – disciplinary field\area which uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and
systems to extract knowledge and insights from structural and non – structural data. i.e. the simplest definition
for data science, the extraction of actionable insights from the raw data.
In simple terms, data science can be understood as strong connection with data including big data and computer
science.
The concept of data science is to unify the statistics, data analysis, machine learning, and many related methods
in order to analyze and understand the actual phenomenon with data.
Data Science connects the applications of different fields\area like computer science and software engineering,
mathematics and statistics, economics and business management. Based on the collection of management,
analysis, visualization, preparation, and storage of large information of the data. In simple terms, data science is
the strong combination of database include computer science and big data.
Skills of Data Science
Data Science is a specialized skill and understood as:
1. Implementation in 4A’s – i.e. Architecture; Acquisition; Analysis; and Archival.
2. Applying advanced techniques in field of mathematics and statistics to model data for deep analysis.
3. Adequate programming and development skills, algorithm development skills.
4. Analytical and ethical reasoning skills; communication and business skills.
The use of cases in data science are similar to data analytics, which begin with a clear problem statement and
decision to give the final end with a well – defined metrics. Therefore, data scientist is considered to be familiar
with business models and paradigms, who ask questions regarding business to obtain meaningful insight from the
data sets.

Stages of Data Science
The life cycle of data science has five stages and they are:
1. Capture: Data Acquisition, Data Entry, Signal Reception, Data Extraction
2. Maintain: Data Warehousing, Data Cleansing, Data Staging, Data Processing, Data Architecture
3. Process: Data Mining, Clustering\Classification, Data Modeling, Data Summarization
4. Analyze: Exploratory\Confirmatory, Predictive Analysis, Regression, Text Mining, Qualitative Analysis
5. Communicate: Data Reporting, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence, Decision Making
Here, all the stages require different methods\techniques, programs, skillsets in some cases depending on the data
given.

Use of Data Science

Data science can be used as:
1. Anomaly detection
2. Automation and decision making
3. Data classification
4. Forecasting in terms of sales, revenue, customer retention
5. Pattern detection
6. Recognition
7. Recommendations based on preferences of the users

Application of Data Science

There are many different applications in different fields in the real world where data science is used to improve
and increase the use of technology required in the society.
For example, Healthcare, Self – Driving Cars, Logistics, Entertainment, Finance, Cybersecurity.
In healthcare, the data science led to a number of breakthroughs. With a vast network of data available from
EMRs to clinical data bases to personal fitness trackers, medical professionals are finding new ways to recognize
the disease, practice medicine, diagnose disease and explore new treatments.
In self – driving cars, the data science led to implementing predictive analytics in the new wave of autonomous
vehicles. Using different programs like machine learning, predictive analytics and data science, to adjust the speed
limits, avoid dangerous lane changes and even take passengers on the quickest route by self – driving cars.
In logistics, the data science led to maximize efficiency, internally and along its delivery routes of the UPS. The
tools use data science – backed statistical modeling and algorithms to create optimal rules for delivery drivers
based on traffic, weather, and other obstacles.
In finance, the data science and machine learning led to the saving in the financial industry millions of dollars,
non – quantifiable amounts of time.
In cybersecurity, the data science led to the ability of instantaneously detect and learn new methods of cybercrime,
through data science, is necessary for safety and security for the future.
In entertainment, the data science led to distinguish between the songs and movies listen or watched by the
audience which helps in making the lists of songs based on off the music genre and band the person is interested
in listening or watching. For example, the songs appeared in the recommendation lists for the audience to listen
and increase their interest.

      '''Digital marketing is everywhere. It’s the boss. You’ve heard of the term, I’m pretty sure.
But just in case if you haven’t, don’t worry mate! We got you covered. How complicated can
it be to get a basic understanding of the term digital marketing? This blog will give you an
understanding of digital marketing, why it’s crucial and just a basic overview of various
types of digital marketing.

Digital marketing has recently boomed a lot, especially in the 2010s. But why is that? What
are the reasons? As the term itself suggests digital and marketing it simply means to do
marketing using digital platforms. Earlier many products and services were marketed via
word of mouth (which is still relevant even today), flyers, brochures, etc. Our ways of life
weren’t online hence the marketing was done offline. But now everything has changed.
People spend a lot of their time online. Wherever people are, you need to market in that
place. So why is digital marketing any relevant? Because that’s where the people are, on the
web/internet. So you’ll obviously market there.

The companies need it more than anything to market their products or services they offer.
You need it the same way whether it’s for your hobby to take it to the best level or for your very own local business. There are many ways digital marketing is possible. So are you
excited? This is how it goes:

It can be done via the creation of content. Content can be anything be it a blog, video,
articles, infographics, tutorials. Whatever it maybe it should boost your business. Your
content can be entertaining, informative that entirely depends on the audience you are
engaging with. Social media is a great place to be. Almost everyone uses social media.
Companies create engaging content for social media all the time. But be careful with the
content when it comes to social media. You need a good understanding of various types of
social media platforms. Sometimes it’s better to write a text, a post, poster, videos that
entirely depends on the social media platform you want to promote your products/services on.
For example, Youtube is the best for video content. People love videos as they are highly
engaging. You don’t have to be a master of all the platforms. Just figure out where is your
audience at? Start with 1-2 social media platforms and then steadily increase.

But how to figure out where is your audience at? Simple answer, Analytics. Yes, I like to call
it the other half of digital marketing. It’s one thing to create engaging content but is your
content reaching the desired audience? What’s the point of all that hard work when people
don’t even know that you exist. Look everyone uses Google for any query. If you fulfill a
query or a need of a certain audience then people should know that you exist. That you are
there for them. The logic here is simple, it’s better to have some than to have it all. When
you use analytics you get a lot of information regarding your content as to what is the age demographic, who is watching your content, from where in the world are they
watching, which social media your audience is active at, etc. It gives you an insight or a
report on your content. You study that and figure out what content to create next on which
platform to create, how to create it etc. In short, analytics makes life easier. There are many
analytics tools available online both free and paid.

Now you can create content to reach an audience organically without paying something to
someone. You can make videos, write blogs, do a podcast but a little cash always helps. Paid
advertisements for your products or services do come in handy. You can run paid ads on
almost any social media. You can even run an ad on Google to rank higher. These are all paid
promotions. You can always choose your demographics for the ads you run. From your page
promotion to products,paid ads are always a good option. And yes for your local
business/shop, you can always make use of Google my business so that your business appears
in the Google search results whenever someone is in need of the services that you provide.
People use Google for almost everything nowadays. You’ll be amazed at just how many
customers come to your shop because of local business. Showing up in your online local
directories is also a good spot.

So whatever paid or unpaid, blog or article, video or podcast whatever you do, it should be
beneficial to the business and above all provide quality to the customers. Digital marketing
comes in various shapes and forms be it a sign-up letter for mail, email marketing, content
writing, social media marketing, paid ads, display ads, influencer marketing whatever you do,
make it good. I hope you learned something and don’t you worry we will cover all these types of marketing in the blogs ahead so stay tuned with us. I’m psyched to see you create
some content. Did I miss out on something? Let me know down below.

      '''Data Science, an inter – disciplinary field\area which uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and
systems to extract knowledge and insights from structural and non – structural data. i.e. the simplest definition
for data science, the extraction of actionable insights from the raw data.
In simple terms, data science can be understood as strong connection with data including big data and computer
science.
The concept of data science is to unify the statistics, data analysis, machine learning, and many related methods
in order to analyze and understand the actual phenomenon with data.
Data Science connects the applications of different fields\area like computer science and software engineering,
mathematics and statistics, economics and business management. Based on the collection of management,
analysis, visualization, preparation, and storage of large information of the data. In simple terms, data science is
the strong combination of database include computer science and big data.
Skills of Data Science
Data Science is a specialized skill and understood as:
1. Implementation in 4A’s – i.e. Architecture; Acquisition; Analysis; and Archival.
2. Applying advanced techniques in field of mathematics and statistics to model data for deep analysis.
3. Adequate programming and development skills, algorithm development skills.
4. Analytical and ethical reasoning skills; communication and business skills.
The use of cases in data science are similar to data analytics, which begin with a clear problem statement and
decision to give the final end with a well – defined metrics. Therefore, data scientist is considered to be familiar
with business models and paradigms, who ask questions regarding business to obtain meaningful insight from the
data sets.

Stages of Data Science
The life cycle of data science has five stages and they are:
1. Capture: Data Acquisition, Data Entry, Signal Reception, Data Extraction
2. Maintain: Data Warehousing, Data Cleansing, Data Staging, Data Processing, Data Architecture
3. Process: Data Mining, Clustering\Classification, Data Modeling, Data Summarization
4. Analyze: Exploratory\Confirmatory, Predictive Analysis, Regression, Text Mining, Qualitative Analysis
5. Communicate: Data Reporting, Data Visualization, Business Intelligence, Decision Making
Here, all the stages require different methods\techniques, programs, skillsets in some cases depending on the data
given.

Use of Data Science

Data science can be used as:
1. Anomaly detection
2. Automation and decision making
3. Data classification
4. Forecasting in terms of sales, revenue, customer retention
5. Pattern detection
6. Recognition
7. Recommendations based on preferences of the users

Application of Data Science

There are many different applications in different fields in the real world where data science is used to improve
and increase the use of technology required in the society.
For example, Healthcare, Self – Driving Cars, Logistics, Entertainment, Finance, Cybersecurity.
In healthcare, the data science led to a number of breakthroughs. With a vast network of data available from
EMRs to clinical data bases to personal fitness trackers, medical professionals are finding new ways to recognize
the disease, practice medicine, diagnose disease and explore new treatments.
In self – driving cars, the data science led to implementing predictive analytics in the new wave of autonomous
vehicles. Using different programs like machine learning, predictive analytics and data science, to adjust the speed
limits, avoid dangerous lane changes and even take passengers on the quickest route by self – driving cars.
In logistics, the data science led to maximize efficiency, internally and along its delivery routes of the UPS. The
tools use data science – backed statistical modeling and algorithms to create optimal rules for delivery drivers
based on traffic, weather, and other obstacles.
In finance, the data science and machine learning led to the saving in the financial industry millions of dollars,
non – quantifiable amounts of time.
In cybersecurity, the data science led to the ability of instantaneously detect and learn new methods of cybercrime,
through data science, is necessary for safety and security for the future.
In entertainment, the data science led to distinguish between the songs and movies listen or watched by the
audience which helps in making the lists of songs based on off the music genre and band the person is interested
in listening or watching. For example, the songs appeared in the recommendation lists for the audience to listen
and increase their interest.
